Basic dashboard
On the first page, the simulator should ask the user what pension they would like to have in
the future. It must not be presented out of context. The pension amount should also be
compared to the current average benefit amount. An object (e.g., a chart) should appear
containing the average pension for a given group, and when hovering over a given group, a
brief description of that group should appear, e.g.: pensions below the minimum: beneficiaries
receiving a pension below the minimum showed low employment activity, did not work at least
25 years for men and 20 years for women, and therefore did not acquire the right to a
guaranteed minimum pension.
Additionally, a random “did you know?” fact should appear, e.g., “Did you know that the
highest pension in Poland is received by a resident of the Silesian Voivodeship; their pension
amounts to x PLN; they worked for x years and were never on sick leave.”
The basic image will be the starting point for deeper analysis—namely, what pension I expect
versus what I will actually receive.
1.2. Pension simulation
At the pension-forecasting stage, the following data should be required:
MANDATORY
• Age
• Sex
• Gross salary amount
• Year of starting work
• Planned year of ending professional activity (by default this should be the year of
reaching retirement age)
OPTIONAL
• Amount of funds accumulated in the ZUS account and sub-account
Additionally, there should be an option “include the possibility of sick leave”—meaning the
simulation should account for the average length of sick leaves over a lifetime separately for
women and men. Information should appear indicating how long, on average, an employed
person in Poland spends on sick leave and how this reduces the benefit on average.
5
The amount of funds accumulated in the ZUS account and sub-account should be optional,
because the amount can also be estimated based on salary. The simulator should reverse-
index wages by the average wage growth in Poland (as published by NBP or GUS) occurring in
subsequent years from the start of work.
After completing all data, an option “forecast my future pension” should appear.
NOTE! The start year of work and the end year of work should always refer to January
